> A simple PE Loader tool that loads a PE from memory, decrypt it, resolve its imports, relocate its sections, and redefine its entry point to execute seamlessly from memory.

## üöÄ Features

- **In-memory decryption**: Decrypts and loads PE files directly from memory.
- **Imports resolution**: Dynamically resolves imports even for complex executables.
- **Section relocation**: Updates section locations based on adjusted memory offsets.
- **Flexible entry point redirection**: Executes the PE with its redefined entry point.

## ‚ú® Features

LoadThatAssembly is a native (C/C++) CLR host that:

- Embeds an obfuscated .NET assembly in the binary (encryptedPE),
- Decrypts it in memory via XOR and validates it is a .NET PE (DOS/PE signatures + COM/CLR directory),
- Initializes CLR v4 using ICLRMetaHost/ICLRRuntimeInfo and starts ICorRuntimeHost,
- Opens the Default AppDomain and loads the assembly directly from a SAFEARRAY
- Retrieves the entry point and invokes it, passing the process arguments as a string[].

Everything is performed fully in memory; no file is written to disk.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è About AMSI/ETW patching**
Before loading the assembly, the program calls:
**patchScanBuffer()**: patches AmsiScanBuffer in amsi.dll,
**patchEcritureEvent()**: patches EtwEventWrite in ntdll.dll.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

- LoadThat-Assembly
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ProcessusT/LoadThat-PEandAssembly.git
cd LoadThatAssembly
python3 encrypt_pe.py <YOUR_PE.exe> <encrypted_pe.txt>
```
Then, replace "unsigned char encryptedPE[]", "size_t encryptedPESize" and "const unsigned char xorKey" into the loader and compile !

- LoadThat-PE
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ProcessusT/LoadThat-PEandAssembly.git
cd LoadThatPE
